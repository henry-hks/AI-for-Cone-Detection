# AI for Cone Detection by Autonomous Car
#### Ho Kai Siu

1. Background
This project is part of the research on Autonomous Guiding System for Formula Student Autonomous (the FSA), which is a driverless racing competition for university student. The other four parts of the research are: the ROS simulation, Real-time monitoring system, PCBs designs and STM32 control and the AI for Map Generation, which are the honours projects of other four students. It is hoped our team could combine these five projects into a big system for the autonomous racing car.
